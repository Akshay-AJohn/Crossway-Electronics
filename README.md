# High-Level Insights
 After the startup period in 2019 sales began to steadily increase. However, 2020 saw a major boost in sales in March coinciding with the beginnig of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.**Strong sales peaks were seen in 2020, particularly in Q1 and Q4, but after that, there was a steady decline in 2021 and 2022**. 
 This might indicate unsustainable growth or challenges in maintaining that level of sales.
* Peak months: November and December show substantial positive growth, which could indicate holiday sales or end-of-year promotions driving the increase.
* Off-peak months: February and October consistently show negative growth, suggesting that the business may need to address slower seasons with targeted marketing or product launches to counteract dips.
