# High-Level Insights
 After the startup period in 2019 sales began to steadily increase. However, 2020 saw a major boost in sales in March coinciding with the beginnig of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.**Strong sales peaks were seen in 2020, particularly in Q1 and Q4, but after that, there was a steady decline in 2021 and 2022**. 
 This might indicate unsustainable growth or challenges in maintaining that level of sales.
* Peak months: November and December show substantial positive growth, which could indicate holiday sales or end-of-year promotions driving the increase.
* Off-peak months: February and October consistently show negative growth, suggesting that the business may need to address slower seasons with targeted marketing or product launches to counteract dips.

## Product Analysis
<div align="center">
  <img src="total sales.png" alt="Product Sales" width="30%"> <img src="order count.png" alt="Product Orders" width="30%">
</div>

- The **Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, Macbook Air, and Thinkpad Laptop** were the highest earning products earning **more than 95% of sales**.
- The Apple Airpods were the most popular product overall with almost 50,000 orders which is double the next most popular product. The Samsung Chargepack was another notably popular product, but its smaller pricepoint meant that it did not contribute as much in sales.
- Compared to the other Apple products, the iPhones lacked substantially accounting for less than 1% of overall sales and orders.
- Purchases across most products occured on the **website earning $27 Million** over the four years compared to just **$800,000 on mobile**.
- The majority of orders attribute "direct" marketing as the main contributor to the sale which accounted for **$23 million**. "Email" was the second with over $3 million.
- The Bose Soundsport Headphones has contradicting performance to the above with all orders occurring on mobile and attributed to email marketing.

## Loyalty Program

</div>

Loyalty Program grew significantly with the COVID bump. It accounted for more than half of orders by 2021, but stagnated ever since.

Guest Checkouts seem largely responsible for the boom in AOV in 2020 spending more per sale than loyalty members. After the boom, however, loyalty program members spend more on average than guest checkout. 

**Should Apollo continue the loyalty program?**

The loyalty program has improved over time, climbing in AOV through the years and accounting for roughly half of sales in 2021 and 2022. Ultimately, there is no reason to remove the loyalty program at this point.

## Regional Analysis
North America accounted for half of sales and orders with EMEA (29%), APAC (12%) and LATAM (7%) accounting for the rest. All regions followed the same general trend lines for sales and orders.

 ## Recommendations:
 The pandemic bump was drastic and Apollo was not able to sustain its growth, but a few opportunities could help the company push for the future.
 
- There have been no new product offerings introduced into the lineup since the Beats Soundsport Headphones and the Samsung Webcam in 2020. Laptops contribute to high sales dollars but highly priced items also have the highest return rates. The Apple Airpods were excellent performers given their relatively low return rates and high sales contributions.
- The Loyalty Program has been showing signs of improvement in 2022. Continuing the program would allow us to collect more data.
